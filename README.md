# Amazon Reviews Sentiment Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze the sentiment of product reviews from Amazon using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning. Sentiment analysis allows us to determine whether a review is positive, negative, or neutral, providing valuable insights into customers' perceptions of a particular product. 

This is our solution proposal for Factored Datathon 2023.
